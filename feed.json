Players moves fast to the new “clone of ..” on “say another blockchain name.”<br>Games who stands against time and have successfully installed a durable user base, do emphasize to the extreme the concept of “pay to win” (which we hate in games cause it defy the idea that gaming is for entertainement) and gets the more and more expensive to play to sustain the economy: those who fail to do so just fall for interest (like a ponzi scheme is supposed to do).<br>It is hard to find a community which is really motivated by the gameplay in the current state of the market.   </p>\n<p>To resume what we have experienced so far about blockchain games, they…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a short life time expectancy or… </li>\n<li>tends to get the more and more expensive to play.</li>\n<li>are boring and repetitive because they lack innovations.</li>\n<li>makes you feel isolated because they lack user interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>In general, we can say that current generation of blockchain games do not invest in gameplay at all and therefore should not be called “games” but “gamified Ponzi” or “gamified investing strategies”.</strong></em>   </p>\n<h3 id=\"analysis-of-key-issues-and-consequences-on-the-blockchain-game-development\">Analysis of key issues and consequences on the blockchain game development</h3>\n<p>Today players interest is oriented in investment or ROI (return of investment) and they need a quick game mechanic so to play only a few minutes a day.   </p>\n<p>Since a blockchain game is backed to token (or a set of tokens), <em>players tends to apply investing strategies instead of fun while playing</em> to maximize returns. </p>\n<p><em><strong>KEY ISSUE “A”: In this scenario as soon as the economy of the token(s) backing the game falls, it is the entire game interest that falls and players just leave.</strong></em>   </p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are a highly volatile market by definition and a token ROI viability can be annihilated in a very short unpredictable time-frame: cryptocurrencies investors are unregulated ([<em>editor’s note</em>] as of time of writing) and this has the consequence that the vast majority of them are inexperienced traders.   </p>\n<p>As a conséquence of the volatility and user human behaviour and as a business owner, <strong>you can’t plan business income in this market</strong>: this is the cause why blockchain game developers writes easy simple games which tend to be repetitive and boring.<br>Those who have expressed a long-term road-map to address a better game later on, hardly reach their goals because as soon as a new game with higher ROI is known then the user-base just leave.   </p>\n<p><em><strong>KEY ISSUE “B”: Blockchain game developers have to deal with inexperienced investors who decide the fate of their product applying investing strategies… in a game.</strong></em> </p>\n<p>A token-based blockchain game, in order to survive and roll out its long-term road-map, must create the chance to have a constantly higher ROI then the concurrence or force the players to not bail-out by vesting or taxing them.   </p>\n<p>Vesting and heavy taxing the users may scare the players, constantly increase the ROI implies semi-Ponzi scheme so the entry-ticket tends to become the more and more expensive progressivly pushing away new players.   </p>\n<p><strong>KEY ISSUE “C”: Long-term blockchain games backed by a token have to deal with the conséquences of players advantaged by the rule “first arrived, better served” and implies a linear decreasing relation between subscriptions and prices; as the entering ticket increases, the user-base rarely follows in linear correlation.</strong>   </p>\n<p>Blockchain games are deterministic, game mechanics are expressed in code which is openly readable on the chain and traders can exploit the simple mechanics to write bots.<br><em>And we might say, why not?</em><br>Current generation blockchain game is so simplistic that they seam to be meant to be played by robots instead of humans.   </p>\n<p><strong>KEY ISSUE “D”: Because of their simplistic nature, blockchain game developers do not spend the time to built mechanics oriented to the human brain and its social expression.</strong> </p>\n<h2 id=\"future-for-p2e-games\">Future for P2E games</h2>\n<p>Here at #P2Enjoy we believe games should be played for fun.<br>As simplistic as this might seems, play to enjoy the gameplay should be the first element of choice for a game to be played.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We created the new <em>hashtag</em> #P2Enjoy to replace the infamous play-to-earn #P2E.<br>And we plan to make the trend stay.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to remove the induced problems of the token economics behind a game, we decided to <strong>remove the token entirely</strong> and focus on a new economic mechanic to backup the game tresory.  </p>\n<p>If you’re interested about how we achieved sustainability wihtout a token, follow our site and read the general game economics whitepaper as soon as this will be disclosed.<br><strong>We engineers our games from bottom-up where the fundations of our games are theirs mechanics and gameplay while the earn economy is built on top of that (not the other way around!)</strong>  </p>\n<p>If you read so far, <em>thank you for your interest on our efforts</em> to make the blockchain game space a better and more enjoyable environnement: you can follow us on the social network via the <a href=\"/tags/contact/\">contact page</a>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"the-founders\">The founders</h5>\n<p>Footnote: <em>All texts, expressed ideas are TM of P2Enjoy, read the <a href=\"https://p2enjoy.studio/notice-on-copyright-and-intellectual-or-industrial-properties/\">notice</a></em></p>\n",
