                <p>This is the main and general whitepaper of a game project.<br><strong>Please remember, this whitepaper is still WIP.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-more-blockchain-games">Why more blockchain games</h2>
<p>There are several blockchain games out there, there will be even more in the next few years: you may wonder why we decided to create our owns; what will you find in our games that we think you won’t find elsewhere?<br>The answer to that question is the source of our motivation, which brings us the existing…   </p>
<h2 id="problems-with-current-generation-block-chain-games">Problems with current generation block-chain games</h2>
<p>I played a lot of block-chain games in the last months and most of the time I rarely enjoyed playing them more then 5 minutes a day…<br>There is a general lack of innovation in the domain: most are just “forks” or “forks of forks” with swords instead of spears for fighting games, engines instead of horses for racing games… and despite being “decentralized”, you are most likely to play alone and on your own: your avatars fighting or running against semi-random mathematical statistics.<br>Current generation of block-chain games tends to have a very low life expectancy: days to weeks at best. Players moves fast to the new “clone” on “say another block chain name.”<br>Games who stands against time and have successfully installed a durable user base, do emphasize to the extreme the concept of “pay to win” (which I hate in games) and gets the more and more expensive to play to sustain the economy: those who fail to do so just fall for interest (like a ponzi scheme is supposed to do).<br>It is hard to find a community which is really motivated by the game-play of these games.   </p>
<p>What we have experienced so far about block-chain games: </p>
<ul>
<li>have a short life time expectancy or… </li>
<li>tends to get the more and more expensive to play.</li>
<li>are boring and repetitive because they lack innovations other then technical and tokeconomical.</li>
<li>makes you feel isolated because they lack user interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In general, we can say that current generation of block-chain games do not invest in game-play at all and therefore should not be called “games” but “gamified Ponzi” or “gamified investing strategies”.</strong></em>   </p>
<h3 id="analysis-of-key-issues-and-consequences-on-block-chain-game-development">Analysis of key issues and consequences on block-chain game development</h3>
<p>Today players interest is more or less only oriented in investment, ROI (return of investment) and they need a quick game mechanic so to play only a few minutes a day.   </p>
<p>Since a blockchain game is almost always backed to token (or a set of tokens) which has an other token counter-value, <em>players tends to apply investing strategies instead of fun while playing</em>. </p>
<p><em><strong>In this scenario as soon as the economy of the token backing the game falls, it is the entire game interest that falls and players just leave.</strong></em>   </p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are a highly volatile market by definition and a token ROI viability can be annihilated in a very short unpredictable time-frame: cryptocurrencies investors are unregulated and this has the consequence that most of them are inexperienced.   </p>
<p>Since you can’t plan business income in this market, block-chain game developers writes easy simple games which tend to be repetitive and boring.<br>Those who have expressed a long-term road-map to address a better game later on, hardly reach their goals because as soon as a cloned new game with higher ROI is available on the cryptoverse then the user-base just leaves.   </p>
<p><em><strong>Block-chain game developers have to deal with inexperienced investors who decide the fate of their product applying investing strategies… in a game.</strong></em> </p>
<p>A token-based blockchain game, in order to survive and roll out its long-term road-map, must have the chance to have a constantly higher ROI then the other games or force the players to not bail-out by vesting or taxing them.   </p>
<p>Vesting and heavy taxing the users may scare investors, constantly increase the ROI implies semi-Ponzi scheme so the entry-ticket tends to become the more and more expensive progressivly pushing away new players.   </p>
<p><strong>Long-term block-chain games have to deal with a number of players mostly determined by their first weeks inscriptions as the prices increases, the user-base rarely follows in linear correlation.</strong>   </p>
<p>Blockchain games are deterministic and statics, game mechanics are expressed in code which is openly readable on the chain and traders can exploit the simple mechanics to write bots.<br><em>And we might say, why not?</em><br>Current generation block-chain game is so simplistic that they seam to be meant to be played by robots instead of humans.   </p>
<p><strong>Because of their simplistic nature (due to the nature of the interest of the players), block-chain game developers do not spend the time to built mechanics oriented to the human brain and its social expression.</strong> </p>
<h2 id="future-for-p2e-games">Future for P2E games</h2>
<p>Here at P2Enjoy Studio we believe games should be played for fun.<br>As simplistic as this might seems, play to enjoy the gameplay should be the first element of choice for a game to be played.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We created the new <em>hashtag</em> #P2Enjoy to replace the infamous play-to-earn.<br>And we plan to make the trend stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to remove the induced problems of the token economics behind a game, we decided to <strong>remove the token entirely</strong> and focus on a new economic mechanic to backup the game tresory.  </p>
<p>If you’re interested about how we achieved sustainability wihtout a token, follow our site and read the general game economics whitepaper as soon as this will be disclosed.
<strong>We have made our game conception from bottom-up where the fundations of our games are theirs mechanics and theirs gameplay, economic was built on top of that (not the other way around!)</strong>  </p>
<p>If you read so far, <em>thank you for your interest on our efforts</em> to make the block-chain game space a better and more enjoyable environnement: you can follow us on the social network via the <a href="/tags/contact/">contact page</a>.</p>
